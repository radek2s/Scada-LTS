<p>Exporting Events to remote location</p>
<p>Events from ScadaLTS can be now stored inside application but also could be exported to remote Data Store
in this case RabbitMQ broker. That allows to ease behaviour of ScadaLTS and speed-up the efficiency of the application
    when there is lots of input/output number of operations caused by Events.</p>
<p>
    What is more this feature can be used to remote managing of the events that has occurred inside Scada application.
    It can notify remote message broker about the new event which has risen. It is delivered to RabbitMQ with special routing key
    which allows to filter messages and receive only desired ones. Each message sent to RabbitMQ has JSON Object format.
</p>
<p>
    Exchange routing key format is <b>X.Y.Z...</b> which means:<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>X</b> - Alarm level [number]</li>
    <li><b>Y</b> - Event type [number]</li>
    <li><b>Z</b> - Message key [alphanumeric]</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Alarm level numbers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 - Informational</li>
    <li>2 - Urgent</li>
    <li>3 - Critical</li>
    <li>4 - Life safety</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Event type numbers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 - Data Point</li>
    <li>3 - Data Source</li>
    <li>4 - System</li>
    <li>5 - Compound</li>
    <li>6 - Scheduled</li>
    <li>7 - Publisher</li>
    <li>8 - Audit</li>
    <li>9 - Maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using RabbitMQ route mask we can set receiver for example to receive:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only URGENT alarms from SYSTEM events. <br>Routing key: <b>2.4.#</b></li>
    <li>All DATAPOINT events. <br>Routing key: <b>*.1.#</b></li>
    <li>All URGENT events. <br>Routing key: <b>2.#</b></li>
    <li>System login events. <br>Routing key: <b>*.*.event.login</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
    From <b>examples/DataSources/amqp/recvRabbitMQ.py</b> you are able to run this script
    with option "-s true" to save received EventLogs to file. If you want specify location
    of log saving directory use "-d [example_path]" option. Files will be saved as JSONs.
