    +-------------------------------------------------+

1. Changed API
- Log4j2 uses now a new API, the main package is called:
  "org.apache.logging.log4j" instead "org.apache.log4j"
- "org.apache.log4j.Logger.getLogger()" must be modified
  to "org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager.getLogger()"
- and much more info in the web:
  https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html

2. We are now using "Log4j 1.2 API" bridge to use the same
   functions from 1.X version in 2.11 version.
- You must not access to the methods and classes from
  log4j1 such as Appender, LoggerRepository and Category
- You must not programmatically configure Log4j
- You must not configure by calling the classes
  DOMConfigurator or PropertyConfigurator.

  *** To use it whole code refactoring is obligatory ***

3. Folder structure

Now the log folder structure has changed. Logs are stored
inside CATALINA_HOME/logs directory BUT it has its own directory.
In the main folder there is a file "ScadaLTS.log" which has
the <root> output inside.
Other log files are stored inside ScadaLTS directory.
When FileRoller reach the maximum size of the log file
it will create a new directory with current date and it
will place the old data int this folder to store archival data.

There is a new structure of log files. There are the most important
log separated into independent files. Each is saved by RollingFile
mechanism wich uses "disruptor-3.3.4.jar" to make an asynchronous
file saving operations by AsyncLogger.  More info about performance
of this feature can be find via this link:
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/async.html

File structure:
 |
 + ScadaLTS.log
 \-+ ScadaLTS
   |
   + ScadaLTS_dao.log
   + ScadaLTS_database.log
   + ScadaLTS_datasources.log
   + ScadaLTS_dwr.log
   + ScadaLTS_flyway.log
   + ScadaLTS_modbus.log
   + ScadaLTS_runtime.log
   + ScadaLTS_view_hierarchy.log
   \ ScadaLTS_web.log

 Max file set size (900MB):
 ScadaLTS_modbus.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
 ScadaLTS_datasources.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
 ScadaLTS_database.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
 ScadaLTS_web.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
 ScadaLTS_dao.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
 ScadaLTS_dwr.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
 ScadaLTS_runtime.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
 ScadaLTS_view_hierarchy.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
 ScadaLTS.log = 10 * 10MB = 100MB
